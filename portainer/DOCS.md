Portainer is an open-source lightweight management UI which allows you to
easily manage a Docker host(s) or Docker swarm clusters.

It has never been so easy to manage Docker. Portainer provides a detailed
overview of Docker and allows you to manage containers, images, networks and
volumes.

## Installation

To install this add-on, you'll first need to go to your profile and turn on
"Advanced Mode", once that is done go back to Home Assistant add-ons and search
for "Portainer" and install it as you would any other add-on.

To be able to use this add-on, you'll need to disable protection mode on this
add-on. Without it, the add-on is unable to access Docker.

   `https://github.com/lmagyar/homeassistant-addon-portainer` as repository.
1. Find the "Portainer" add-on and click it. If it doesn't show up, wait until
   HA refreshes the information about the add-on, or click **Check for updates**
   in the **...** menu at the top right corner.
